# Peer to Peer for IoT devices
This is the software implementation for a peer to peer network aimed at 
Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

## Description:
This project is an implementation of Senior Capstone Experience for Computer
Science majors at Earlham College. The software accompanies a paper, which
is the primary deliverable. Since we are proposing a protocol that is geared
towards IoT devices, we will produce a sample app that can live in the network
and do it's job. This repository contains the development codes. Bugs, incomplete
features are a expected. We will possibly use this to host project website as 
well. If you have any question/suggestion, please send me an email to 
ssalek14@earlham.edu

## Progress:
1. Server capable of handing multiple concurrent connections
2. Client with connecting and data excahnge capabilties

## ToDo:
- [ ] Produce a state diagram
- [ ] Add more literature into the first draft of the paper
